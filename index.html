				<p><b>STATEMENT</b>
I observe elements and details in the everyday that trigger my curiosity. Once triggered, I extract, enhance, and distil these elements, whether they consist of ideas we live by, relations we engage in, cultural habits and interactions, or objects we surround ourselves with. By processing the familiar in this way, I aim to pose open ended questions about life and how to live it, as individuals or as a community.
<p>
My love for the impossible entity we call reality is endless, hence the medium of photography and video forms a broad part of my production. However, my choice of medium is always project and context dependent, so sound installations, as well as landscaping and sculptural work, can also be found amongst my projects.
