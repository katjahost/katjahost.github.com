				<p><b>STATEMENT</b>
I observe and document elements and details in the everyday that trigger my curiosity. Social structures and practices, as well as collective memories and identity, are recurring themes in my work. By processing the familiar in this way, I aim to pose open ended questions about life and how to live it, as individuals or as a community. 
<p>
My love for the impossible entity we call reality is endless, hence the medium of photography and video forms a broad part of my production. However, my choice of medium is always project and context dependent, so sound installations, as well as landscaping and sculptural work, can also be found amongst my projects.
