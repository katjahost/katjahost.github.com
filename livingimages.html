			<h3>Synopsis - <i>Living images</i></h3>
				<ul>
					<p>The starting point of this project is the artist's self-imposed demand that her camera should always toggle along as a gentle reminder to pay attention to, and record, the everyday life. The artist seeks to give a voice to the familiar and mundane filling the broader part of everyday life. The aim is to process on a more conscious level whatever is already there, rather than directing the lens towards the more dramatic and spectacular in life and society, generally attracting far more attention. The project has so far produced a photobook (published in 2017 at Teknisk Industri AS) and a solo exhibition at <i>Digitaliseum</i> in Malmö, Sweden (2018), where a selection of photographs from the book were presented alongside 3 videos from a new video-based project: <i>Living images.</i></p>

					<p>The video project <i>Living images</i> consists of an expanding number of short videos (so far durations span from 20 seconds to 7 minutes) filmed with a handheld camera, without any edits in time, frame or focus. Thus, the videos approach the quality of the still image, while still displaying the particularity of the moving image: movement and time. The element of time is further underscored by the fact that near all the videos are edited to perform seamless loops, creating an illusion of a scene lasting indefinitely. The videos can be displayed in a variety of formats, with a variety of devices and combined in different ways depending on context.</p>

					<p>In <i>The bird</i> we see a sparrow repeatedly flying into the same window, apparently trapped in an endless attempt to fly into the room. In <i>As long as there is light I</i> and <i>II</i> sunlight, shadows and reflections play the lead role. <i>Leafy breath</i> shows a pile of leaves that seem to be breathing and the video <i>Only death will last forever</i> presents a plastic bag, shaking as it hangs of the steering wheel on a bike. The shaking stems from the deathcamps of a mackerel recently fished out of the water. The mackerel takes 7 minutes to enter eternity.</p>

					<p>The project can be read as a love declaration for camera-based media as well as the impossible entity we call reality. Simultaneously, the project carries an attitude related to what we pay attention to in life as well as in art. It contains a belief that processing the familiar trough the camera (historically known to hunt the spectacle), also allow us to pose open ended questions about life and how to live it.</p>
